# Guition piggyback
Small add-on pcb that hooks to the SD card slot of Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040 development board to create a simulated standby flight instrument.

Inspired by [CC_G5 project by Chris Crawford](https://github.com/ccrawford/CC_G5), makes it possible to add an encoder and power button to the Guition development board without soldering.
